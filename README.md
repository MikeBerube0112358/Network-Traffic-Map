# Network-Traffic-Map
Maps network traffic using google maps

This Python script visualizes network traffic geographically using pcap data. It extracts IP addresses, maps them to their geolocations using the pygeoip library, and generates a KML file for visualization on mapping services like Google Maps. The script also captures live web traffic and fetches the user's public IP. It's a valuable tool for network analysis and cybersecurity visualization.

This project was built with help from "Violent Python A Cookboook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers", and from "Python Cybersecurityâ€” Network Tracking using Wireshark and Google Maps" by Vinsloev
